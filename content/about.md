Hello there!

My name is Aaron Dominic, and I am currently an undergraduate student studying at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. I am interested in a broad range of topics in theoretical computer science and math. This blog is mostly going to be me writing about random projects that I will be doing.

You can DM me on discord if you want to contact me. I would love to talk!
