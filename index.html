(1986) 62-76</a>. What the author tries to do there is actually very similar to what I am doing! They also design a purely deterministic CA to simulate the Ising model. But they seem to have taken a different approach where instead of having a single giant heat bath seperated from the main Ising sim, they couple a tiny heat bath of capacity 3 to each cell. This is actually&mldr; a really elegant idea. It requires only 16 states, and there is no need for a seperate heat bath. I still feel my method is much more fun, as it seems much more like a physical material, and this allows you to measure a lot of interesting quantities like thermal conductivity, by sandwitching it between two baths, similar to how you would measure it for a real material.</em></p><p>In the last post, we saw how thermodynamics in general works in CA.

Thw reverse rule happens to be itself, with the checkerboard flipped. To see this, what we do is that we apply the rule without flipping the chessboard pattern. Because of the chessboard pattern, the number of neighbours of a particular color for each changed cell remains the same, and so the exact same states gets flipped again. Hence the step gets reversed.</p><p>As we know that this rule is both reversible and energy-conserving, we can apply thermodynamics here.</p><p>But, here a problem is that unlike the previous case, we cannot assume all the energy locations are independent, so there is no obvious way to determine temperature. But the same definition still works: The energy needed to increase entropy by one unit.</p><p>To actually measure the entropy, there is a known formula, but it is very complicated. And the formula can be found only after you find the exact solution to the model, so I think it&rsquo;s cheating to use that. That is why to actually work with temperature, we couple it with a system whose temperature can be easily calculated.</p><p>Now, you can use this even without a heat bath to calculate the graph between energy density and magnetisation. Here is approximately how they would look (I got lazy, these are the graphs when it is coupled to the heat bath with slow energy loss, but they should look the same)</p><p><img src=/images/Evm.png alt="E vs m"></p><p>Some observations:</p><ul><li>I cut off the graph at low energies.

. This is where the phase transition happens!</li><li>It is extremely noisy and not smooth. To get a proper smoothed graph we will have to take multiple samples at each energy level and do some averaging. This is STATISTICAL mechanics, so nothing is absolute, everything is always fluctuating.</li></ul><p>It gives the expected results, but the phase transition is not very satisfying to watch. To see proper one, we will need to move on to designing and interface between our heat bath and our Ising CA.</p><h3 id=the-interface><a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href=/posts/ising-ca-part-2/#the-interface>The Interface</a></h3><p>The interface basically consists of a row of cells that can carry energy both in the form of HPP energy packets and Ising bond energy.
The big picture idea behind its evolution is very simple: In every step where it is active, it interconverts energy between its Ising form and its gas form. I&rsquo;ve tried to make this visible through the icons given to each state.
The only problem is that we must respect the chessboard update pattern and reversibilty and all the conservation laws.</p><p>Proving this manually for every CA transition rule is not easy as there will be a lot of states because the two CAs have pretty different ways of energy conservation, and this means it is not straigtforward for the interface to conserve energy. Hence, to simplify matters, I decided to divide every step of the CA into two substeps:</p><ul><li>Energy movement</li><li>State permutation</li></ul><p>The movement of the HPP gas and the Ising spin flip both happen under step 1. The HPP reflection rule, interface energy tranfer and the chessboard alternation all happen under step 2.</p><p>By ensuring that both steps satisfy energy conservation and reversibility, we can prove the final rule does so too, which makes enforcing these much simpler.</p><p>The proof of reversiblity and energy conservation of the first part can be directly copied from the same proofs for HPP and the Ising CA.</p><p>For the second step, note that all possible energy transfers are compulsory, so on doing it again the energy just gets transferred back.</p><div class=viewer><textarea style=width:100%;max-width:100% rows=5>

The standard format accepted by most widely used CA software is the <a href=https://golly.sourceforge.io/Help/formats.html#rule>rule table</a>.</p><p>In this format, rules are specified as transitions. For example the line</p><pre tabindex=0><code>0, 0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1, 1</code></pre><p>signifies that a 0 cell with exactly three 1 neighbours turns into a 1.
It also supports variables, which allow you to compact multiple transitions into one line.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is a pain to write manually and hence <a href=https://github.com/supposedly/nutshell>Nutshell</a> was created. Nutshell adds several helpful features like independent variables and temporary symmetry switching.</p><p>While designing the rule, the number of nutshell transitions also turned out to be pretty large (54) so I decided to write a python script to generate the transitions for me. It also allowed me to properly incorporate the 2 step way of thinking about the rule that I had described. It also makes debugging and iterating much simpler.</p><p>So in the end, to generate the rule file you have to run my code and then copy-paste the output into a template. This template would contain the rule name and the icons for every state. Then we have to compile that using Nutshell. And then paste the output rule file into Golly. Which turns out to be an extremely convoluted workflow&mldr;.</p><p>Lot of the complexity arises due to the fact that energy conservation and reversability are both not natural concepts in the rule table format. Another complication is that the symmetry obeyed by the HPP gas involves a rotation and a state permutation, so it is not natively supported anywhere. So you have to manually specify all 4 directions seperately.</p><hr><footer><ul class=Tags><li class="Tags-item u-background"><a class="Tags-link u-clickable" href=/tags/all/ rel=tag>All</a></li><li class="Tags-item u-background"><a class="Tags-link u-clickable" href=/tags/cellular-automata/ rel=tag>Cellular Automata</a></li></ul></footer></article><div class=Divider></div><article><header class=Heading><h2 class=Heading-title><a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href=/posts/quadratic-fractals/ rel=bookmark>Quadratic Fractals</a></h2><time datetime=2025-10-09T01:15:16+05:30>October 9, 2025</time></header><blockquote><p><span style=color:gray>How to make pretty pictures?</span></p></blockquote><p>I love fractals!

. It is very hard to find a good set of numbers, as most choices just lead to boring blobs or just emptiness. So, these numbers were determined using an algorithm called simulated annealing, which basically tries to mimic how nature seems to find good solutions by randomly jumping around. The objective it tried to maximise was basically the number of pixel changes at boundaries, i.e, it tried to make the boundary between the two regions as large as possible.</p><p>There is a famous family of fractals called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set#Quadratic%20polynomials>filled julia sets</a> which are related to another fractal called the Mandelbrot set. Some filled julia sets are associated with the main heart shaped region (i.e. cardioid) of the Mandelbrot set. It is interesting that these are a subset of our family of fractals, but they tend to look very different.</p><p>You can find the code I used to create these images <a href=https://github.com/Aaron-d-k/Quadratic-fractals/tree/main>here</a>. You can run it to try and create more such fractals (Also, it allows you to zoom in and out). I thought of embedding it here using emscripten, but it ends up being insanely slow on web.</p><p>Some interesting technical challenges I faced:</p><ul><li><p>I actually considered the more general 12 parameter functions with constant terms too. This includes famous fractals like the Hénon map. But I encountered a frustrating issue where there would be fractals that seemed to look intricate to my SA due to the limited number of iterations, but were actually just empty because there wasn&rsquo;t any attractor (i.e. all the points were black)! Another issue was that there was no fast way to determine convergence other than waiting and hoping everything else goes off to infinity. To fix these, I just decided to limit myself to functions with a fixed point at 0.</p></li><li><p>How to determine if a point is going to converge to zero?
We can find out if points close to 0 always tend to get closer by calculating something called the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant>Jacobian matrix</a> of the map at 0. If all the eigenvalues of this matrix satisfy
<span class=katex><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>λ</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">|\lambda|&lt;1</annotation></semantics></math></span>
, then it is attracting. The reason this works is actually pretty clever, the idea is that near the fixed point, the function behaves like its Jacobian. You can usually decompose any vector as the sum of two eigenvectors and If all the eigenvectors contract due to the mapping, it is apparent that their sum should also go to zero.</p></li><li><p>Using the previous proof to find a lower bound for the radius of the region where all points definitely converge to 0 is not trivial. You have to take care of the fact that even though the function might be squishing points towards 0 overall, it could temporarily cause some nearby points to go farther and take this into account when bounding the quadratic terms.</p></li><li><p>Some fractals looked too ugly and dusty. I tried fixing it using a Gaussian blur, but that just made it look smudged. After trying a few techniques I felt that median blur seemed to look best.</p></li></ul><p>This family of maps actually includes a lot of fractals called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor#Strange_attractor>strange attractors</a> and what appears to be non-chaotic ring-shaped attractors but due to how my visualization works, you unfortunately cannot truly appreciate their beauty here. I actually want to try and explore the ring attractors and how they deform into strange attractors as the parameters continuously change, because that is something I have never seen before.</p><hr><p><em>Edited (Oct 14): Improved wording</em></p><footer><ul class=Tags><li class="Tags-item u-background"><a class="Tags-link u-clickable" href=/tags/all/ rel=tag>All</a></li><li class="Tags-item u-background"><a class="Tags-link u-clickable" href=/tags/fractals/ rel=tag>Fractals</a></li></ul></footer></article><div class=Divider></div><article><header class=Heading><h2 class=Heading-title><a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href=/posts/ising-ca-part-1/ rel=bookmark>The Ising Model and CA, Part I: Thermodynamics in CA</a></h2><time datetime=2025-09-23T00:07:56+05:30>September 23, 2025</time></header><blockquote><p><span style=color:gray>Can thermodynamics be applied to a cellular automaton?

The most fundamental definition of temperature is the amount of energy needed to change the entropy of the system by one unit. To me, this is a very beautiful definition as it immediately makes it clear why energy must always flow from a hot body to a cold one: due to the second law!

On reflection, this should make sense: Temperature is an intensive variable, so it shouldn’t depend on the size, only on the density of the chaos.</p><p>One funny thing you might notice is that temperature here isn’t actually strictly positive: when the density exceeds 50%, entropy decreases with gain in energy. This concept of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_temperature>negative temperature</a> is actually well known, but is very rare in real life. And these states behave as if they are hotter than infinite temperature. For this reason, in some places, I will prefer to use thermodynamic beta instead, which is much nicer to work with and is just the reciprocal of temperature in natural units.</p><h3 id=how-is-the-hpp-gas-relevant-to-the-ising-model><a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href=/posts/ising-ca-part-1/#how-is-the-hpp-gas-relevant-to-the-ising-model>How is the HPP gas relevant to the Ising model?</a></h3><p>In order to set up a CA we need a heat bath. So why not use this as a heat bath? Unlike the Ising model, we have an extremely simple formula to calculate the temperature, so we can try and couple it with the Ising CA and use it to calculate temperature. The key insight is that the laws of thermodynamics must hold regardless of the exact details of the coupling, as long as we respect reversibility and energy conservation.</p><p>This is extremely vague for now, I will expand upon more details of how exactly we are going to simulate the Ising model and how the coupling works in my next posts. For now, you can play around with final rule and try to figure out how it works.</p><div class=viewer><textarea style=width:100%;max-width:100% rows=5>
