  The Ising model and CA, part I: Thermodynamics in CA






  Introduction

The Ising model is a famous model of phase transition in a ferromagnetic material. It can be simulated using many methods, famously MCMC methods leading to pretty looking simulations like this one:
TODO
This basically uses a randomized method that ensures that the generated grid is sampled from the probability distribution we would get if we coupled such a system to a heat bath. The Ising model doesn’t really have a fixed dynamics, the only fixed thing is the energy of each state and the Boltzmann distribution. The main problem with directly trying to port this directly into CA is that we do not have any way to perform randomization. Also, this system does not really conserve energy, and if I really wanted to do physics using CA, I really want it to be realistic.">

<p>Well, thermodynamics usually makes no sense in a CA context. What is energy? Temperature? The stereotypical example of a CA, Conway’s Game of Life, has pretty much no conserved quantities. It also doesn’t have time reversibility. So it is a pretty bad model of physics and so thermodynamics makes no sense here.</p>
<p>In order to actually have a sensible notion of thermodynamics, we will have to design a CA with these properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time reversible</li>
<li>Having some conserved quantity</li>
<li>Chaotic behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>Lucky for us there already exists a CA with these properties… behold! the HPP lattice gas! If you have heard of HPP before, you might be thinking that this makes no sense. HPP is a model of a fluid, and since all particles have the exact same average kinetic energy, you might think that every configuration would have the exact same temperature.</p>
<p>In order to tackle these problems, we will have to properly define and reinterpret things. In the following exposition, we will think of each particle of the HPP gas as a ‘energy packet’. Hence, conservation of energy just becomes equivalent to the conservation of particle number. We shall take one particle as one unit of energy.</p>
<p>Also, the HPP lattice gas happens to be its own time reversal under a simple state transformation, which proves its reversibility.</p>
