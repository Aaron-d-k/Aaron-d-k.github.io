# [Mountain Land](/mland.html)

This is a small browser based game that allows you to explore an infinite computer-generated mountainous landscape. 

# [Quadratic Fractal Explorer](/dispfractal.html)

Still very unpolished, but for now it allows you to explore a very small set of quadratic fractals as described in one of my posts. *Controls: Right/Left click to zoom in/out, up-arrow/down-arrow to change parameters, A/D to adjust speed, S to change view.*
