I love fractals! Mostly because I think they look really pretty, but also because they show us how much detail and complexity is hidden even in the simplest of systems.

Recently, while trying to learn about heuristic algorithms, I thought that trying to find fractals that are as intricate as possible sounds like a nice toy problem, as it is very complex to optimise directly but should be doable for a heuristic program. Here are some samples of the results: (Hopefully my color palette isn't too painful to look at)

These fractals were generated by running a very simple program, almost the same as the one used to create filled julia sets. We consider a quadratic map \(f:\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2\) 
$$
f(x,y)=(ax^2+bxy+cy^2+dx+ey,fx^2+gxy+hy^2+ix+jy)
$$
Then we iterate every point using this map and see what happens.

In the preceding images, green represents the points whose iterates converge to zero, black/blue represents the points going to infinity and red represents those doing neither (as far as the program could calculate). The brightness is determined by how many iterations it took for the program to determine its behaviour.

The map \(f\) is determined by 10 parameters \(a,\cdots ,j\) and these parameters were determined by simulated annealing. The objective function it tried to optimise was basically the number of pixel changes at boundaries, i.e, it tried to make the boundary between the two regions as large as possible.

It is interesting to note that although the set of filled julia sets of the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is a subset of this family of fractals, they tend to look very different.

You can find the code I used to create these images [here](https://github.com/Aaron-d-k/Quadratic-fractals/tree/main). You can run it to try and create more such fractals (Also, it allows you to zoom in and out). I thought of embedding it here using emscripten, but it ends up being insanely slow on web.

Some interesting challenges I faced:
- I actually considered the more general 12 parameter maps with constant terms too. This includes famous maps like the Hénon map. But I encountered a frustrating issue where there would be fractals that seemed to look intricate to my SA due to the limited number of iterations, but were actually just empty because there wasn't any attractor! Another issue was that there was no fast way to determine convergence other than waiting and hoping everything else goes off to infinity. To fix these, I just decided to limit myself to fractals with a fixed point at 0.

- How to determine if a point is going to converge to zero?
We can find out if 0 is an attracting fixed point using the Jacobian matrix of the map at 0. If all its eigenvalues satisfy \(|\lambda|<1\), then it is attracting. The reason this works is actually pretty clever, the idea is that near the fixed point, the function behaves like its Jacobian. You can usually decompose any vector as the sum of two eigenvectors and If the all the eigenvectors contract due to the mapping, it is apparent that their sum should also go to zero. 

- Using the previous proof to find a lower bound for the radius of the region where it definitely converges is not trivial. You have to take care of the fact that even though the map might be contractive overall, it could temporarily cause expansion along some directions and take this into account when bounding the quadratic terms.

- Some fractals looked too ugly and dusty. I tried fixing it using Gaussian blur, but that just made it look smudged. After trying a few techniques I felt that median blur seemed to look best.

This family of maps actually includes a lot of strange attractors and what appears to be non-chaotic ring-shaped attractors but due to how my visualization works, you unfortunately cannot truly appreciate their beauty here. I actually want to try and explore the ring attractors and how they deform into strange attractors as the parameters continuously change, because that is something I have never seen before.
